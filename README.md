# Lawyer-Dashboard
This is a technical test project by mylawlegal.com for an internship position. 
There's a backend(was unable to complete it because I still had to learn a few things and there was no 
much time left as it was almost getting close to the deadline)and a frontend built with ReactJs.

#Frontend Section Charting library used: Recharts 
Js data structure used: JavaScript Objects 
Sample of data used: [{name: 'Jan', id:0, lawyer: ['Esq. Adeniji', 'Esq. Umar'], active: 2, closed: 4, new:7}, 
{name: 'Feb', id:1, lawyer: ['Esq. Alamu', 'Esq. Ebuka'], active: 2, closed: 0, new: 3}, ...]. 
The graph plot generated from the data above shows the relationship between the amount of cases 
and month in which they were operated on (active, close, new). Furthermore, similar additional 
data structures were created to help render a new graph plot based on a filter operation on the front end (View by: this month, last 6 months, year).
